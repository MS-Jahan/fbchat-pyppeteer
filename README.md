# fbchat-selenium

This project is not completed yet. I'm currently unable manage time for this. Also, the async thing seems like a headache for me (at present).

# Testing (As isn't not ready yet)
1. Install all dependencies: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Change the Google Chrome/Chromium binary file location in `helper.py` file. If you can't find the line, search for `executablePath` in the `helper.py` file.
3. Run the `main.py` file: `python3 main.py`.
4. Login from the browser when prompted.
5. You'll get logs (except some errors) when certains events (reaction, message sent, message seen etc.) take place.
